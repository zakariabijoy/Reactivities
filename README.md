# Reactivities
Asp.Net Core WebApi with React Maintaining Clean Architecture with CQRS and MediatR

# Running WebApi:
- Just run API project by visual studio or using cli by "dotnet watch run" command.
- Get All Activities API URL: https://localhost:44300/api/activities or https://localhost:5001/api/activities (if you run project using cli)

# Note:
- No need to change connection string cause I use sqlite in this project.
- Migration will automatically done cause this feature is included in the project
